# Mobile Menu Overlay Fix

This fix addresses the issue where the mobile menu overlay was appearing in front of the sidebar, covering everything in black. The fix ensures the overlay appears behind the sidebar menu for a better user experience.

## Changes Made

1. **Created a CSS file** (`public/css/menu-overlay-fix.css`) that:
   - Sets the z-index for the navbar-collapse to 1040, making it appear above the overlay
   - Sets the z-index for the mobile-menu-overlay to 1030, making it appear behind the sidebar
   - Ensures proper styling for the sidebar menu with appropriate positioning and box-shadow

2. **Updated the mobile-menu-fix.js file** to:
   - Create and position the overlay properly with the correct z-index
   - Set the mobileMenu to have a higher z-index than the overlay
   - Handle overlay creation and removal properly

3. **Added the new CSS file to the app.blade.php** layout

## How It Works

When the mobile menu is opened:
1. The overlay is created with a z-index of 1030
2. The sidebar menu is shown with a z-index of 1040
3. This ensures the sidebar appears above the overlay, while the overlay darkens the rest of the page
